# Training Process:
1. Initialize the weights of the neural network
2. Feed the input data through the network and calculate the output
3. Calculate the error between the predicted output and the actual output
4. Propagate the error backwards through the network and calculate the gradients of the weights
5. Adjust the weights using the gradients and a learning rate (a hyperparameter that determines how much the weights should be adjusted)
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for a certain number of epochs(iterations over the entire dataset)
